## Reflections

I've built similar games in Ruby, but this was my first time really using object-oriented programming in Javascript. A lot of the concepts are similar, but it's very different in practice.

I really got hung up trying to keep the code meticulously organized and trying to keep as much of the code as possible within a module or factory function. Ultimately, I wasn't making progress, so I added a lot of code to global functions and then moved what I could inside of the objects later.

The biggest fundamental difference between this Javascript tic-tac-toe project and the projects I've done in Ruby is creating and working with all of the DOM elements. 

Declaring variables for DOM elements and adding all of the event listeners is really verbose. In the future, I hope to improve on writing code for DOM elements more succinctly.
